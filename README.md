Quiz Game was created in 2017 & 2018 to enable me to practice trivia questions. I figure that someday I'll try out for Jeopardy. My goal is to win at least one game. So I made this web application to enable myself to get unlimited practice.

Quiz Game has three different collections of questions:
* Jeopardy Questions

   Every Question from every show until 2015. (Over 200,000 questions total)
   
* Quiz Bowl Questions

   Every Question from College Quiz Bowl from 1996-2008 (Over 7,900 questions total)
   
* Stanford NLP Questions

   Questions from the Stanford Natural Language Processing classes. (Over 98,000 questions total)
